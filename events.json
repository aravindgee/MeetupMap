Players on the waiting list can show up if they would like in hopes of a player does not show up. However we will NOT sub you in if all players on the confirmed roster are present. If a player decides to sub you in and you are from the waiting list, then it’s their responsibility to sub for each other and they are NOT allowed to sub out anyone else.<\/p> <p><b>If you show up late<\/b>  and we had to use a player from the waiting list, then you will lose your spot.  We recommend everyone to show up on time. <\/p> <p><b>What happens if you RSVP and you do not show up?<\/b><\/p> <p>You will be placed on the waiting list for the next game. If you continue to RSVP and do not show up, you will be blocked from the group. To avoid this, we ask that you give at least 24 hours notice of changing your RSVP to allow members from the waiting list to join. We understand that emergencies may arise and we will take that into consideration.<\/p> <p><b>IF YOU CHANGE YOUR RSVP TO \"NO\" ON SUNDAY after 12:00 AM, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON THE WAITING LIST FOR THE FOLLOWING GAME.<\/b>  if you can please update your RSVP in a timely manner to allow other members to come play.

This group and Jersey City will NOT provide you with insurance coverage.  I request that you that you play at a fun level.<\/p> <p>While we are always open to new ideas on how we can improve on this venue, we will NOT change the game play or rules at this time. Please understand that we obtained this beautiful field for us to experience the game at its full length.  Anyone who disturbs the organization rules will be asked to leave. If you wish to make a recommendation, please see the organizers in person first.<\/p> <p><b>Weather Conditions<\/b><\/p> <p>We will play even if it's raining.

Come out and join us!<\/p> <p>We have cones and flags so all you need is cleats if that is what you prefer. GAMES WILL ALWAYS BE PLAYED REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS i.e. rain, snow, cold, mud, ice, storm, hurricane, etc...we never cancel games due to weather...games are fun and competitive, all skill levels are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>NOTE: PLEASE RSVP \"YES\" ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW UP TO THE GAME.  YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RSVP IF SOMETHING COMES UP (OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IF IT'S TOO COLD\/IT'S RAINING\/IT'S SNOWING) AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT.  NO-SHOWS WILL BE REMOVE FROM THE GROUP.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCURATE HEAD COUNT SO WE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMING.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>ere are some of the new changes we have made and a reminder of some of the guidelines we already have:<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>1) You can not add  guests to your RSVP.  Anyone is free to come and play IF AND ONLY IF you have a profile in meetup and have joined our group.  It's 100% FREE to join and it only takes about 2 minutes to sign up and RSVP.  There are also FREE mobile apps for iPhones and Android phones so you can RSVP easily on the go.  If any of your friends has been playing and wants to continue to play, ask them to go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Cunningham-Park-Football\/<\/a> and sign up and RSVP individually.  YOU CAN NOT PLAY if you're not signed up and RSVPd.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>2) The first 20 people that RSVP for the game, will play a 9-on-9 game with 1 sub.  Everyone on the waiting list will pick players and play against the winner of the game.  Games will be to 2 scores.  If a team gets 2 scores, with the score 2-1, the other team gets one (1) more possession to try to score and tie the game.  If the game is tied again, the game is now to 3 points and the same rule applies, once one of the teams gets score #3, the other team gets just one (1) more possession to try to tie the game.  If 20 or less players show up to the game, game can be played to whatever score everyone agrees to.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>3) If you're one of the first 20 to RSVP, but you're late, the next person on the waiting list that's present on the field will take your place and play in the first game.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>4) On a safety, ball stays at the goal line and the next down will be played.  For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and a safety occurs, the ball stays at the goal line and the 3rd down will be played.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>5) On an OBVIOUS \"Defensive Pass interference\", the ball will stay at the line of scrimmage but you reset your plays and start at 1st down again.  For example: If a 3rd down play is ran and a DPI occurs, the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and a 1st down will be played, then 2nd, then 3rd...etc.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>6) On an OBVIOUS \"Offensive Pass interference\", the ball stays at the line of scrimmage and the offensive time will lose a down.  For example: If a 2nd down play is ran and an OPI occurs, the offensive team will now be on a 4th down situation from the line of scrimmage.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>7) As you might have noticed we have had very few injuries (knock on wood) throughout the years.  This is why we wanted to remind you of the following:<\/p> <p>-Stiff arrming, flag guarding and hand slapping are NOT ALLOWED.<\/p> <p>-Blocks from the back are NOT allowed ad they're obviously dangerous and can cause injuries.<\/p> <p>-VERY IMPORTANT: If you are the offensive player and have the ball in your hands, you MUST avoid contact and CAN NOT under any circumstances lower your shoulders and try to initiate contact with an defensive player.  This is flag football, if you're looking for a different type of game there are plenty of other places and leagues to play flag or full-contact football.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>8) Donations:  I pay the monthly fee for hosting these meetups and never charge anyone.  All we asked for you is to drop at least $1 in the container we have set up for this, all the money is used for equipment, flags, cones, etc.  You can click on \"Group Tools &gt; Money\" and see where all the money is going.  If we buy anything with that money we record the transaction and upload a picture of the receipt of whatever equipment we bought.  Next thing we want to get are end zone weighted pylons and we want to buy orange rope so we can mark the field faster and more accurately to avoid any arguments about where the first down is or what not.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>IMPORTANT: WE ARE ALL ADULTS AND OBVIOUSLY CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING.  WE NEED EVERYONE'S COOPERATION TO FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES TO KEEP THE GAME FUN AND COMPETITIVE.  IF FOR ANY REASON YOU DISAGREE OR BELIEVE THAT THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT FIT YOUR STYLE OF PLAY OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A PICK-UP GAME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT MEETUP GROUP OR IN ANY OTHER PICK-UP GAME...NO HARD FEELINGS.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>If you have any suggestions, questions or concerns, please feel free to reach me at[masked] or [masked]<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>Regards,<\/p> <p>Carlos<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p> <\/p> <p> <\/p>","name":"Flag Football Game - Sunday @ 9:00 am","headcount":0,"group":{"id":1706490,"created":1284434687000,"group_lat":40.75,"name":"Cunningham Park Flag Football","group_lon":-73.98999786376953,"join_mode":"approval","urlname":"Cunningham-Park-Football","who":"Members"}},{"rsvp_limit":18,"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"id":"qwhvmjysqblc","utc_offset":-18000000,"distance":4.837985992431641,"duration":7200000,"time":1419775200000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1414167686000,"yes_rsvp_count":17,"created":1399839715000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/BklynPickupSoccer\/events\/219227494\/","description":"<p> <\/p> <p><b>THE GAME<\/b><\/p> <p>Informal Meet Up. 8 vs 8. 2 subs per team.

We will play at the South end of the baseball field parallel to 110th street so that we're not in the way of the baseball games. Riverside will be our backup if for some reason we need to change locations.<\/p> <p><b>RIVERSIDE DETAILS<\/b><\/p> <p>The Riverside location is all the way West just off the water between 102nd and 108th Streets. You can only enter the park at 103rd and 108th. The best way to get there is to take the 1 local to 103rd Street. Walk West until you see an entrance that takes you down to the fields through the park. After walking down the steps from the street, you will see a path that goes left and another that goes right. Walk down the left path until you see a stone wall and stairs that go down to the fields. From South to North there will be one small soccer field surrounded by a track (red 'A' on map), another field with two softball fields (closer to 103rd\/104th st) and another that is a giant soccer field (closer to 106th st). After walking down the steps, you will see the small Soccer field on your left. Start from this Southern-most field and walk North on the path to find our game. If you see no one, the meeting spot is the South side of the large soccer field. This spot is identified on the map below, a small square with little dots around it. On days when we can't find space at Riverside, we will move the game to Morningside Park (West 110th St and Manhattan Ave).<\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/4\/8\/2\/event_131793922.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","how_to_find_us":"Look for flying discs...","name":"Sunday Ultimate @ 1PM, Riverside Park","headcount":0,"group":{"id":374316,"created":1164744359000,"group_lat":40.79999923706055,"name":"FRIENDLY NYC Ultimate Frisbee","group_lon":-73.97000122070312,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"NYCUltimate","who":"Ultimate Frisbee Players"},"why":"It's fun and you like it..."},{"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":13893672,"lon":-73.986168,"repinned":false,"name":"59th Street & 5th Avenue, north side of Central Park South west of Fifth Avenue","state":"NY","address_1":"north side of Central Park South west of Fifth Avenue","lat":40.74622,"city":"New York","country":"us"},"id":"218080482","utc_offset":-18000000,"distance":0.8899197578430176,"duration":7200000,"time":1419789600000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1419270326000,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"created":1415302093000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Animals\/events\/218080482\/","description":"<p> <\/p> <p><b>Please join the <a href=\"http:\/\/banhdc.org\/\">Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages<\/a> and concerned activists to protest the inhumane, cruel and abusive horse-drawn carriage trade.<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Stand with us as we educate tourists and others not to take these rides.<\/b><\/p> <p><b><img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/4\/9\/f\/e\/600_389178942.jpeg\" \/><\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Supporting the carriage trade is supporting  institutionalized cruelty.

There’s no better way to get around while doing your holiday shopping! Dating back to the early part of last century, the Nostalgia Train is made up of subway cars in service along the lettered lines between the early1930s to the mid-1970s. Equipped with ceiling fans, padded seats and incandescent light bulbs, the R\/1 through R\/9 cars served the IND and later some BMT lines. Customers will have the opportunity to hop on board as it operates along the Sixth Avenue M Subway Line Icon Line.<\/p> <p>“Holiday shoppers, tourists and those who just remember a bygone era will have the opportunity to experience a ride on a subway train from yesteryear, said MTA New York City President Carmen Bianco. “With a little bit of luck and good timing, riders will be able to catch a ride on this classic subway train at stations along the M Subway Line Icon line between Queens Plaza and Second Avenue.”<\/p> <p>Many New Yorkers bear fond memories of the trains. However, with the cars having been out of service for nearly 40 years, many more New Yorkers have never experienced the charm of wicker seats and ceiling fans. The holiday “Nostalgia Train” will operate on Sundays only, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., with the last one on December 28th.<\/p> <p>NOSTALGIA TRAIN HIGHLIGHTS:<\/p> <p>Car No. 100 --- Manufactured by American Car and Foundry, this R1-type car was the first car in the initial order of 300 cars placed in service for the opening of the IND subway.<\/p> <p>Car No. 484 --- Part of a 500-car order of R4 cars manufactured by American Car &amp; Foundry. In 1946, this car received a retrofit of bulls-eye lighting and a public address system.<\/p> <p>Car No. 1575 – Originally manufactured as an R7, this car was involved in a wreck in 1946. Sent to the American Car &amp; Foundry factory, the car, which is equipped with fluorescent lighting and smooth sides, was rebuilt as the prototype of the next generation R10 subway car.<\/p> <p>The nostalgia won’t be limited to the subway. Bus customers using the M42 crosstown route will have the opportunity to ride a vintage New York City bus for the holiday season. Everything will be original except the fare. The crosstown buses run from Monday through Friday, December 1st through December 19th .<\/p> <p>The historic fleet is appreciated by Transit's top managers for their historic significance. \"These buses are a living, breathing part of the city's history and each has a unique story to tell about the era in which it operated,\" says Darryl Irick, Senior VP of NYC Transit Department of Buses and President of MTA Bus and a former Bus Operator himself. \"When you examine this collection as a whole, the progression of motorized surface transportation in New York City really comes to life.\"<\/p> <p>Many of the vehicles in NYC Transit’s historic fleet have been deemed to have historical significance to the city, including bus number 3100, a 1956 GM which was the first air-conditioned transit bus to operate in the City, and 5227, the last non wheelchair-accessible bus to operate for NYC Transit, pulled from service in 1993.<\/p> <p>While most of the preserved and restored vehicles were ordered and operated by NYC Transit, the earliest buses belonged to predecessor companies, notably the Fifth Avenue Coach Company, which was founded in 1885. The historic fleet is made up largely of so-called \"old look\" buses (built prior to the Autumn of 1959) and \"new look\" models (buses with slanted windows and enlarged windshields built in Pontiac, Michigan from the Autumn of 1959 until the introduction of the RTS in 1977).<\/p> <p>General Motors and Flxible are the most heavily represented manufacturers, though there is also a 1956 Mack in the collection.

It has been called Akasha, Logos, the primordial OM, the music of the spheres, the Higgs field, dark energy, and a thousand other names throughout history. The vibratory field is at the root of all true spiritual experience and scientific investigation. It is the same field of energy that saints, Buddhas, yogis, mystics, priests, shamans and seers, have observed by looking within themselves. Many of history's monumental thinkers, such a Pythagoras, Kepler, Leonardo DaVinci, Tesla, and Einstein, have come to the threshold of this great mystery. It is the common link between all religions, all sciences, and the link between our inner worlds and our outer worlds.<\/i><\/p> <p><img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/4\/f\/2\/600_422545842.jpeg\" \/><\/p>","name":"Spiritual Movie Night: Inner Worlds, Outer Worlds","headcount":0,"group":{"id":4549022,"created":1344977985000,"group_lat":40.81999969482422,"name":"Rosicrucians in New York City","group_lon":-73.94000244140625,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"Rosicrucians-in-New-York-City","who":"Seekers"}},{"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":23524492,"lon":-73.981667,"repinned":false,"name":"THE BAR ","state":"NY","address_1":"210 WEST 55TH STREET 1ST FLOOR","lat":40.764462,"city":"New York","country":"us"},"id":"219113416","utc_offset":-18000000,"distance":0.405058354139328,"time":1419807600000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1419260216000,"yes_rsvp_count":28,"created":1417964193000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/socialsinglesatwys\/events\/219113416\/","description":"<p><b>FAST FACTS - PLEASE READ:<\/b><\/p> <p>*We can not accept payment at the door for these events.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p>Join other single professionals for an early evening happy hour, topped off with about* 7-10 rounds of \"mini-dates.\" You'll meet each member of the opposite sex for 5-7 minutes each (depending on the size of the event), turn in your dating card and then we'll send you the contact info of your mutual matches 48 hours later. On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.<\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br\/>$27 - PRE-PAYMENT ONLY WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR<\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:<\/b> h<a href=\"https:\/\/2014nycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\">ttps:\/\/2014nycspeeddating.eventbrite.com<\/a><\/p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>If you don't get any matches, you'll receive a promo code so you can try another event at half price!<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p>\n\n<b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

This is a great place to ask the tough questions, find answers, and grow in faith. People of all faith background and seekers who consider themselves \"irreligious\" will all feel comfortable here. Leave each time feeling balanced and ready for the busy week ahead.<\/p> <p>This week's discussion has been dubbed: \"How to Delete Your Guilt &amp; Start Fresh in 2015.\" Wow - quite an interesting title, but it sparks our interest because many of us have blown it once or twice (or even thrice) this past year. It leaves us wondering:<\/p> <p>~ What do I have to do to be 100% certain I am on good terms with the God of the Bible?<br\/>~ What happens if I have committed the same wrong act many times over?<br\/>~ Is it possible to delete the guilt for my wrongdoings so that it doesn't count against me in the end?<br\/>~ How do I know whether or not I will be eligible for Heaven?<br\/>~ Is there some accountant in Heaven carefully weigh my good &amp; bad deeds on a balance in order to see which wins out?<br\/>~ If there really a loving God out there who wants to forgive me, or is the idea of forgiveness just a fairy tale?<\/p> <p>The Bible hasn't left us in a hopeless wrestling match with our questions. Woven into the central theme of the Bible's storyline is the answer to many of our deepest questions about morality, sin, guilt, and what to do when we blow it. We just need to know where to look for the answer, and this is exactly what we are gathering to do this Sunday evening.

You must pre-pay to secure your spot in the event.<\/p> <p>*Business casual attire requested. No sneakers, t-shirts or active wear, no ripped jeans.<\/p> <p>*We limit our events to 12 couples\/24 people. (See reason below)<\/p> <p>*You will have approximately 8-12 dates.*<\/p> <p>*Matches are tabulated and emailed to attendees 48 hours after the event.<\/p> <p>*Event lasts about 90 minutes give or take 10 minutes between check-in and all speeddating rounds.

But how many times have you chatted with someone just to have them fade or never make plans to meet? How many dates have you had that you thought went well and then ended up confused because you never heard from that person again?<\/p> <p>The upside of online dating is that it provides us with so many options. The downside is that people start to believe that their options are endless, which leads them to move on quickly seeking that \"perfect\" match.<\/p> <p>This is where speeddating comes in. To try and combat the \"shopping cart\" mentality of online dating, we limit the number of attendees to 10-12 per gender.  Fewer choices to distract us means that people are more likely to make a connection. Face to face conversations result in fewer flakes. That means fewer people get put on the back burner.<\/p> <p>Join other single professionals for an early evening happy hour, topped off with about* 7-10 rounds of \"mini-dates.\" You'll meet each member of the opposite sex for 5-7 minutes each (depending on the size of the event), turn in your dating card and then we'll send you the contact info of your mutual matches 48 hours later. On average, 80% of those who attend end up with at least one or two mutual matches.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><b>PAYMENT POLICY:<br\/>$27 - PRE-PAYMENT ONLY WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENT AT DOOR<br\/><\/b><\/p> <p><b>REGISTER AND PAY HERE:<\/b> h<a href=\"https:\/\/2014nycspeeddating.eventbrite.com\">ttps:\/\/2014nycspeeddating.eventbrite.com<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/atwysnycspeed2014.eventbrite.com\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p> <p><b>(SEE MORE FAQ's BELOW)<\/b><\/p> <p><i><b>If you don't get any matches, you'll receive a promo code so you can try another event at half price!<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/b><\/p> <p><br\/><b>FAQ'S<\/b><\/p> <p><b>The Organizer RSVPD with X amount of people.

We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our artistic work full-out and then putting our work out there for others to experience. We become closeted artists, and if we do manage to express ourselves artistically, we shy away from sharing it with others, with the world — full-out. <\/p> <p>We fear criticism mostly. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. Mainly, we are just too self-critical. There is nothing holding us back but us. <\/p> <p>When we see this negative pattern with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our creative work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our \"work\" becomes our \"play.\" We will use The Work of Byron Katie, a powerful but gentle tool for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do. Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be.<\/p> <p>A little about me: <\/p> <p>I am an artist and writer and have been a working actor in film, television and theatre, a journalist,  a club musician, and a teacher.  I've written over 20 plays, some of which were performed Off-Broadway and in Europe. My art has garnered over 25 exhibitions and can be seen at &lt;a&gt;www.benhendersonpainting.com. &lt;\/a&gt;I have also written five screenplays, one of which that has been sold.  I have coached at least 100 creative artists in moving forward with their careers.  I have practiced The Work of Byron Katie for 8 years and lead inquiry groups using her work for over seven.  I lead  writing workshops in New York as well.   One is called \"The Writer's Gym\" which you can check out at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Writers-Gym-for-Playwrights-and-Screenwriters\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Writers-Gym-for-Playwrights-and-Screenwriters\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Writers-Gym-for-Playwrights-and-Screenwriters\/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br\/>and the other is \"Memoir Writing\" at<\/p> <p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/usingthe-pastforideas-com\/events\/216785252\/\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/usingthe-pastforideas-com\/events\/216785252\/\" class=\"linkified\">http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/usingthe-pastforideas-com\/events\/216785252\/<\/a><\/a> <\/p> <p><br\/>I hope to meet you soon!    <\/p> <p>Ben, Your Organizer<\/p>","headcount":0,"name":"Dissolve the Internal Blocks that Thwart Our  Creative Expression","group":{"id":17017142,"created":1410829207000,"group_lat":40.7599983215332,"name":"Unblocking Your Creativity","group_lon":-73.98999786376953,"join_mode":"open","urlname":"UnblockingYourCreativity","who":"Creative People"}},{"status":"upcoming","visibility":"public","maybe_rsvp_count":0,"venue":{"id":1063200,"zip":"10019","lon":-73.998687,"repinned":false,"name":"Pier 94","state":"NY","address_1":"711 12th Avenue ","address_2":"55th st & The West Side Highway","lat":40.764397,"city":"New York","country":"us"},"id":"217678372","utc_offset":-18000000,"distance":0.8334276080131531,"time":1419897600000,"waitlist_count":0,"updated":1416959221000,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"created":1415146749000,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/immaculate-electronica-NY\/events\/217678372\/","description":"<p>Tickets on sale Friday nov 7.

With eyes closed (you will be seated and a healer will stand nearby; no touching is involved), a CRS healer, trained in <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i> and spiritual reading\/healing, will observe you with his inner sight, free of any judgments, as your truly are, a perfect shining spirit. Together, will ask the Holy Spirit (or Inner Guide if you prefer) to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and ask for guidance about how your spirit really wants to make use of your present situation for its growth and sharing of love. After about 10 minutes of meditation, we will share the inspirational guidance that we receive. <\/p> <p>Aside from sharing the message that we receive from the Holy Spirit, we don't talk during this meetup event. We share healing quietly and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.<\/p> <p>We'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.<\/p> <p>We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit\/energy or what you will.<\/p> <p>A Note About the Role of Words in Healing: \"Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing. The motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you receive. But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality....\" — <i>A Course in Miracles Manual for Teachers, Section 21<\/i><\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>\"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed.

This is a core GTD tenet that is ofttimes misunderstood and misapplied, and conflated with organizing! Well, this Meetup is dedicated to clearing that up for everyone in attendance. :-) We will discuss what the next-action principle is, discuss how we all approach it and what tools we use (for collecting and organizing) on either side of the next-action, but how we fundamentally get better at determining and naming next-actions (especially versus projects). Then, we'll discuss some more advanced aspects of next-action management. This is going to be an engaging discussion with so many facets of GTD yet to be covered. So, bring your recommendations, copy of GTD (the book), and questions for the group discussion!<\/p> <p><b>III.

In contrast, DGR offers a concrete plan for how to stop that destruction.<\/p> <p>\n\nAs an aboveground movement, just now taking its first steps, Deep Green Resistance is based on this analysis and implementing this strategy. And we’re recruiting.<\/p> <p>\n\nNo more ineffective actions – piecemeal, reactive, and sad. No more feel-good, magical-thinking, navel-gazing, consumer-based, capitalist-approved denial and dead ends.<\/p> <p>\n\nThe goal of DGR is to deprive the rich of their ability to steal from the poor and the powerful of their ability to destroy the planet.

All attention goes to this spot for 15 minutes and both partners simply experience what raw connection feels like at the meeting point between the most sensitive spot on the body and the most dexterous appendage of the body.
